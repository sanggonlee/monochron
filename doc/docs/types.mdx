## RootBucket

RootBucket is the top level bucket which represents one time slice in the timeseries data.

```ts
RootBucket {
  t_start: string;
  t_end: string;
  entries: Bucket[];
}
```

| Field   | Type                                | Description |
| ---     | ---                                 | ---         |
| t_start | string                              | Start time of the data slice of your data bucket. It maps to the position of the bar's left side, if the data for bar is newly entering. |
| t_end   | string                              | End time of the data slice of your data bucket. It maps to the position of the bar's right side, if the data for bar is exiting. |
| entries | Array<[Bucket](/docs/types#bucket)> | List of data buckets, where each item will map to an individual bar in the chart. |

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/rootbucket.png")}/>

It represents one time slice (whose width maps to the time interval) of the entire timeseries data.

## Bucket

```ts
Bucket {
  key: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  data: unknown;
  buckets?: Bucket[];
}
```

| Field   | Type                                | Description |
| ---     | ---                                 | ---         |
| key | string | Key of the bucket. Should be unique among its peer buckets. |
| start | number | Start time of the bucket data, in milliseconds. NOTE: This will automatically be filled and overwritten by monochron if you're working with TimeseriesChart. Only applicable if you're working with RealtimeChart. |
| end | number | End time of the bucket data, in milliseconds. NOTE: This will automatically be filled and overwritten by monochron if you're working with TimeseriesChart. Only applicable if you're working with RealtimeChart. |
| data | unknown | Data object of your entry. You can use this field to format your row as you like. In TypeScript you will need to cast this to your known type, i.e. `const person = bucket.data as Person;` |
| buckets | Array<[Bucket](/docs/types#bucket)> | Optional. monochron supports recursive rows in the chart (i.e. rows in a row in a row, etc). Structure buckets if you're intending to do this. |
---
<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/bucket.png")}/>

It represents a single row (at whatever depth) in the chart.

## RenderRowFunc

```ts
type RenderRowFunc = (
  value: Bucket,
  RowComponent: (props: RowProps) => ReactElement
) => ReactNode;
```

The function you can use to format your row. See `renderRow` prop of [TimeseriesChart](/docs/timeseries-chart) or [RealtimeChart](/docs/realtime-chart).

## Row

```ts
<Row
    key={key}
    start={startTime}
    end={endTime}
>
    <p>My row</p>
</Row>
```

You cannot import and use `Row` directly. You will be passed this component in [RenderRowFunc](/docs/types#renderrowfunc)
